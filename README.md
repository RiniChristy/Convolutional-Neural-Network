# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Image classification by Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with TensorFlow backend. Both binary and multiclass classification are attempted on two different datasets. Binary classification is done with a binary_crossentropy loss function & sigmoid activation function and multiclass with 10 classes is executed by changing  loss function to categorical_crossentropy  & activation function to softmax. 

Trials to achieve the best accuracy possible with different techniques to improve and tune a CNN model are performed by changing number of convolutional layers, number of hidden layers, number of feature detectors, optimizers & finally Batch Normalization.   

The trained and tested model is then used for future prediction of similar images.
